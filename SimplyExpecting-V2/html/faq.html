                            <h3>Is it safe to start Pilates while I am pregnant?</h3>
                            Absolutely. Pilates is perfectly safe to do during pregnancy. It is a great idea to keep your body in top shape during
                            the pregnancy and to help recovery after the baby is born. The sooner you start the better. However if you have had a
                            history of miscarriages or prior complications during a pregnancy it is best to consult with your midwife/doctor before
                            you start.

                            <h3>Is Yoga or Pilates best during pregnancy?﻿﻿</h3>
                            Both Pilates and Yoga help prepare the mind and body for pregnancy and birth using breathing techniques and specific
                            exercises to open the hips and strengthen the core. Neither one is better than the other and it comes down to personal
                            preference. Yoga and Pilates are very complimentary to each other and if you can why not do both.

                            <h3>Will Pilates help me to n​ot pick up weight?</h3>
                            ​It is normal and healthy to pick up weight during your pregnancy. Your midwife/doctor will be able to work out how
                            much weight you should pick up based on your usual weight. Pregnancy is a time to embrace the changes that happen
                            to your body.
