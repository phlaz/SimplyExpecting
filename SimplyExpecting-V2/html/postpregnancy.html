                <h1>Post Pregnancy Classes</h1>
                <p>
                    Postpartum rehabilitation exercises are very important for any new mother whether her baby is 3 months or 3 years.
                    The earlier you begin the better but there is no set time frame and it is never too late. These classes will help
                    strengthen the pelvic floor muscles, heal diastasis recti (separation of abdominals) and reactivate the abdominal
                    muscles.
                </p>﻿
                <p>
                    For normal vaginal delivery without any complications, six weeks is the estimated time that mothers can start with
                    the classes. If the birth did not go as planned or recovering from a C-Section, it is best to wait until 8-12 weeks
                    or with your medical practitioners consent.
                </p>﻿﻿
                ﻿
                <h2>Healing a Diastasis Recti</h2>
                <p>
                    What is a Diastasis?<br />
                    ﻿Diastasis recti is a condition where the right and left sides of the rectus abdominus (the muscle that makes up the
                    front wall of the abdominals, also known as the “six-pack” muscle) spread apart at your midline.
                </p>﻿﻿
                <p>
                    ﻿After pregnancy is the ideal time to begin working with a diastasis recti, trying to close it and avoiding making it
                    worse. Some of the exercises that we want to avoid initially are traditional Pilates abdominal exercises that include
                    flexion and flexion with rotation where the head, neck and chest lift off the floor. The reason we want to avoid these
                    exercises are because when a diastasis is present, especially in the early postpartum period, it compromises the ability
                    of the abdominal wall to function properly and to perform those exercises with proper muscular engagement, form and
                    control. Simply put until the muscles are repaired, able to fire correctly and support the movement and contraction
                    involved in certain exercises, it is advised that participation in such exercises be delayed (this goes for over weight
                    and obese non-postpartum individuals that have a diastasis as well).
                </p>
                <p>
                    After birth, the muscles of the abdominal wall and the pelvic floor have been stretched, pushed, and challenged to their
                    maximum making it difficult for post partum women to properly feel, activate and use those muscles during a number of
                    different exercises, including those that involve traditional flexion. Also, because the muscles of the abdominal wall
                    have been stretched out toward the sides of the torso it can compromise the way in which the muscle fibers are firing.
                    This is why it is best to wait a couple months if not more until repair, healing and the initial re-strengthening has
                    occurred to introduce traditional flexion exercises again.
