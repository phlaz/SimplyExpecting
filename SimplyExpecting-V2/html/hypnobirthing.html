                <h1>HypnoBirth﻿ing® - The Mongan Method</h1>
                <p>
                    HypnoBirthing® - The Mongan Method - is a unique method of relaxed, natural childbirth education, enhanced by self-hypnosis
                    techniques.
                </p>
                <p>
                    ﻿HypnoBirthing is based on the belief that all babies should come into the world in an atmosphere of gentility and calm.
                    It is a comprehensive ante natal course that teaches the parents-to-be that birth is natural, normal and healthy. Special
                    attention is placed on breathing and deep relaxation techniques for a faster and more comfortable labour, often eliminating
                    the need for chemical anesthesia, episiotomy and other medical interventions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This technique was developed by Marie Mongan in 1989. Back in the 1950’s when Marie discovered she was pregnant with her
                    first child she got her hands on Dr Grantly Dick-Read’s book on Natural Childbirth and was very much looking forward to
                    a natural relaxed birth.  Even though her labour was smooth and pain-free she was drugged for the birth and awoke sometime
                    later, violently ill from the ether and was informed she had “delivered” a baby boy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The same happened at the birth of her second child and only after telling her doctor she would fire him if he didn’t allow
                    her the birth she wanted, was she able to have the birth she wanted with her husband at her side which was unheard of in
                    those days. Years later she helped her daughter birth in the same calm serene manner and as a result developed the
                    HypnoBirthing®  program that is now recognized all over the world.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The program uses Hypnosis as a tool. Hypnosis is easily described as ‘focused relaxation’ where the subconscious mind is
                    open to suggestion and does not mean you will be ‘controlled’ by the person hypnotizing you.  Relaxation is proven to be
                    one of the most effective tools for dealing with tension, stress and discomfort and together with visualization can help
                    the body birth without the need for drugs. During the course, each couple with learn breathing, relaxation and
                    visualization techniques that they will practice at home so they can call them up readily when they are needed during
                    labour. This ensures that both mind and body are well prepared.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The course is taught over 5 consecutive weeks of sessions of 2.5 hours each. All course materials, HypnoBirthing®
                    textbook and relaxation cd are provided. Any women over 20 weeks and her birthing companion (husband, partner, mother,
                    doula etc) may attend.

                        <q>We have convinced ourselves that labor is risky</q>, says Marie Mongan, MEd, MHy, founder of HypnoBirthing® - The Mongan
                        Method. Fear during labor activates our primal fight-or-flight mechanism, causing stress hormones called catecholamines to
                        slow down digestion, make the heart speed up, force blood to the arms and legs, and ultimately deplete blood flow to the uterus,
                        creating uterine pain and hindering the labor process.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        According to Mongan, who is a hypnotherapist and hypnoanesthesiologist, it is physically impossible for the body to be relaxed
                        and in fight-or-flight mode. By replacing fear with relaxation, a different set of chemicals come into play: oxytocin, labor
                        hormones called prostaglandins, and endorphins combine to relax the muscles and create a sense of comfort.
