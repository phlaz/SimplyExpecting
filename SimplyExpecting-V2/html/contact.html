                    The pilates classes were fantastic as they helped to keep me in shape during pregnancy. Classes were very relaxing and
                    also helped to ease back and leg aches and pains.

                    ﻿I really enjoyed the pregnancy Pilates especially because it was something new for me to do during pregnancy that helped
                    me stay in 'shape'. The breathing techniques were a saving grace during my labour. As this was my third pregnancy it was
                    extremely taxing on my body. I really needed all the breathing techniques they helped me stay focused. Thank you Michelle
                    you and your class were a big help during my pregnancy and labour.

                        ﻿My husband and I attended the HypnoBirthing Course which we thoroughly enjoyed. I made use of the breathing and
                        relaxation techniques during my labour. Without the techniques I would not have been able to cope with my 48 hour
                        labour which culminated in me giving natural birth in a hospital!
                        Michelle was patient and went out of her way to help us understand more advanced topics with regards to pregnancy
                        and child birth. Michelle’s passion and concern even continued beyond the classes as she followed up with our queries
                        and showed genuine interest with our baby’s progress and well-being.
                        We are truly grateful to her for helping us and would highly recommend the HypnoBirthing Course to anyone who is
                        looking forward to a calm and less painful birth.
